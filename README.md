# DestroyMessages

this is a simple plugin requested by u/JamatoP


[here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html) is a list for all the materials that you can use as an option in the config.yml

# HOW IT WORKS

Basically you add a Block from the List above to the config in the "blocks" section (in proper yaml formatting!) as the key and the message as the value of it. 


The message can contain any placeholder from PlaceholderAPI as well as *{PLAYER}* for the name of the player who broke the block.
If needed I can also add support for Prefixes and Ranks in the Messages!

**A basic config will always be created to showcase all of these features!**
